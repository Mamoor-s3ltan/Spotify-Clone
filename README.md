# Spotify Clone

This project is a clone of the popular music streaming platform Spotify, created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It aims to replicate the core features of Spotify's web player, including responsive design for various screen sizes, a custom player with volume controls, and song access through clickable song cards.


## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The web application is designed to be responsive, ensuring an optimal viewing and usage experience across different devices and screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **Custom Player with Volume Controls:** Unlike the original Spotify web player, this clone incorporates a custom player with volume control functionality, allowing users to adjust the volume according to their preferences.
- **Clickable Song Cards:** Users can access songs by clicking on the song cards, which are designed to resemble the album artwork or cover of each song. This intuitive interface makes it easy for users to navigate through the available music library.



## Technologies Used
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript** 




## Usage
To use the Spotify Clone, simply open the provided HTML file (index.html) in a web browser. Once loaded, you can browse through the available songs by scrolling through the song cards. Click on any song card to start playing the corresponding song on the custom player. Use the volume controls to adjust the volume as desired.
